<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
<div

class="section level2">
<h2><em>The Democratic Presidential campaign <strong>must</strong>
establish their strategy to secure electoral victory.</em></h2>
<p>Previous research shows that voter turnout shapes election outcomes.
When voter turnout is high, it often indicates a high level of
engagement and enthusiasm among the electorate, which can lead to more
representative results. Conversely, low voter turnout can skew outcomes,
as it may reflect apathy, disenchantment, or barriers to participation
among certain demographics. Elections with low turnout rates risk being
decided by a smaller, potentially less diverse subset of the population,
which can distort the democratic process. Furthermore, variations in
voter turnout across different regions or demographic groups can
significantly impact the final results, influencing everything from the
composition of legislative bodies to the outcome of specific ballot
measures or initiatives. Therefore, understanding and addressing factors
that affect voter turnout is essential for ensuring fair and
representative democratic elections.</p>
<p>By analyzing voting patterns from the previous four National election
cycles (2016-2022), the Democratic Presidential campaign can obtain
valuable insight on key voter demographics, including voter turnout and
preferences, which can help information strategic decisions regarding
messaging, campaign outreach, and policy priorities to effectively
engage and mobilize supporters in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>Following the primary elections earlier this year, we are now certain
that the 2024 Presidential Election will be a Biden-Trump rematch. While
the political environment has changed since their previous face-off in
2020, we can gain valuable insight on general trends in among voter
demographics. In a time of immense polarization where both candidates
are are well-established incumbents, the Democratic campaign can not
rely on vote flipping. <em>Therefore, with the U.S. General Election
only about six months year away, <strong>Democrats need to consolidate a
strong voting base that will turn out to on election day if they want to
ensure a win.</strong></em></p>
</div>

<div id="methodology" class="section level1">
<h1>METHODOLOGY</h1>
<p>Following each election, the Pew Research Center surveys U.S. adults
online to study trends in voter turnout and choices. Using this survey
data, I am analyzing subsets of voters with low voter turnout for
general trends that may be expected to continue in 2024.</p>

<p>I originally accessed the survey data on March 21, 2024.</p>
</div>
<div id="trends-in-voter-turnout" class="section level1">
<h1>TRENDS IN VOTER TURNOUT</h1>
<p>As shown in the chart below, voter turnout disparities persist across
racial, educational, and gender lines. While there is some variation
from election to election, these trends have remained remarkably
consistent over the past four election cycles. This indicates that voter
turnout is <em>not</em> random but rather influenced by structural and
demographic factors.</p>
<p><img src="Code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>Recognizing these demographic trends, the Democratic campaign has a
strategic opportunity to strengthen its voter base by targeting and
mobilizing nonvoters. The data highlights that young and less-educated
individuals consistently make up the largest share of nonvoters,
particularly among women. Since these patterns have remained stable over
multiple election cycles, campaigns must address the systemic barriers
that prevent these groups from voting, such as lack of access to
resources, political disengagement, and economic instability.</p>
<p>As identified in an article by <a
href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/voter-turnout-united-states?utm_source=chatgpt.com">PBS
News</a>, several factors contribute to low voter turnout, including
restrictive voting laws, lack of competitive elections, voter
disillusionment, and logistical challenges. No single cause fully
explaining the trend. However, to address these challenges and close the
participation gap, campaigns can implement voter education efforts,
grassroots organizing, and digital outreach strategies tailored to the
demographics most heavily impacted. Addressing these obstacles could
significantly increase turnout without necessarily needing to convert
opposition voters.</p>
<p>If the Democratic campaign successfully engages nonvoters in 2024, it
could expand its electoral advantage by broadening its base.
Understanding what motivates these groups to vote—whether through policy
concerns, community-driven activism, or outreach from trusted
sources—will be critical. Specifically, this chart identifies young and
low-educated individuals as the two largest shares of nonvoters,
especially within the female population. How do these groups vote when
they do turn out?</p>
</div>
<div id="trends-in-low-educated-voter-preferences"
class="section level1">
<h1>TRENDS IN LOW-EDUCATED VOTER PREFERENCES</h1>
<p>Voters with some college education or less have consistently
represented the largest subgroup of nonvoters over the past four
election cycles. However, voter turnout among this group increased in
2022 increased, suggesting that engagement efforts may be beginning to
have an effect. These demographic shifts point to a key opportunity for
campaigns to target and mobilize nonvoters, especially those with lower
levels of education, as a way to expand their base and increase
turnout.</p>
<p><img src="Code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The stacked bar chart above illustrates voting patterns among
individuals with a high school education or less and those with some
college education. The data shows that while these voters, particularly
those with a high school education or less, predominantly support the
Republican Party, the margin remains competitive across each election
cycle. Although the Republican Party has gained ground among
low-educated voters, the trend is not overwhelmingly one-sided. The
Democratic Party still holds a substantial share of support, though
turnout from this group remains an issue.</p>
<p>Given that the Democratic Party traditionally receives more support
from low-educated voters, especially those with high school education or
less, the lack of turnout among these voters could explain the
Republican Party’s increasing dominance in this group. To address this,
campaigns should focus on engaging these voters by targeting the root
causes of political disengagement, such as economic instability, limited
access to resources, and political disillusionment. By enhancing voter
education efforts and increasing outreach to this demographic, the
Democrats could shift the trend in their favor in future elections.</p>
</div>
<div id="trends-in-young-voter-preferences" class="section level1">
<h1>TRENDS IN YOUNG VOTER PREFERENCES</h1>
<p>Young voters, the second largest subgroup of nonvoters, are a key
demographic that overwhelmingly supports the Democratic Party. As the
next Presidential Election will be a rematch of 2020, it’s insightful to
examine the voting patterns of this age group in the previous election.
The bar chart below displays the voter shares each candidate received
from young voters aged 18-49 in 2020, offering a glimpse into the
Democratic advantage among this group.</p>
<p><img src="Code_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="960" /></p>
<p>The chart highlights that, collectively, Democrats received majority
support from all age groups between 18 and 49. However, the most
significant support came from the youngest voters—those likely voting in
their first Presidential election, aged 18-24. This group overwhelmingly
backed Joe Biden, reflecting a strong preference for Democratic
candidates.</p>
<p>To build on this momentum and continue securing the support of young
voters, the Democratic Party can invest in targeted outreach programs,
develop tailored messaging that resonates with their values, and further
engage in community organizing initiatives. By maintaining and expanding
this base of support, the Democrats can boost voter participation, grow
their voter base, and potentially gain a decisive advantage come
election day.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusion" class="section level1">
<h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
<p>Across the last four election cycles, patterns reveal that turnout is
not random; rather, it correlates closely with identifiable demographic
factors. <strong><em>With the 2024 General Election quickly approaching,
the imperative for Democrats is clear: to secure victory, they must
consolidate a formidable voter base characterized by robust
turnout.</em></strong> This necessitates a strategic approach that
identifies and engages eligible voters within their base who have
historically exhibited lower levels of electoral participation, such as
young voters. By deploying targeted campaign tactics aimed at motivating
these segments of the electorate, the Democratic campaign can bolster
its presence at the polls on Election Day. Additionally, by prioritizing
outreach to previously marginalized constituents, such as low-educated
voters, can help neutralize Republican advantages and potentially shift
the balance in the Democrats’ favor. Through these concerted efforts,
Democrats can not only strengthen their electoral prospects but also
uphold the foundational principles of representative democracy.</p>
